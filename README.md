# Plants gone Extinct
The visualization prototype can be found at https://6859-sp21.github.io/a4-cindy/.

This visualization contains data on extinct plant species around the world. The data comes from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list of Threatened Species (Version 2020-1) and was scrapped and prepared by Florent Lavergne.
The data consists of three files. 
- Plants.csv contains lists of plants with their scientific names, country, and last seen date. 
- Threats.csv indicates the types of threats which contributed to the extinction of each species.
- Actions.csv indicates the conservation actions that were taken to preserve species.
